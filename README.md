# FBLA-Coding

This project is for the Coding & Programming competition in Future Business Leaders of America. This program tracks community service hours of chapter members, and also automatically tracks progress for the Community Service Awards.

## NOTE

Dual compatibility will be coming in the near future!

## Getting Started

**Find the download button in green at the top right corner of the page (clone or download). Click this then click the Download ZIP option.**

Once downloaded extract the zip and proceed to Mac Start.

### Mac Start

To run the program on a mac is very simple. Choose between the GUI start or the command line start, the GUI start is recommended. 

#### GUI Start (Easiest)

Open finder, go into the FBLA-Coding-master folder, then two finger click the mac_start.command file and click open. You will then be prompted saying this is from an "unidentified developer" disregard this and click open.

#### Command Line Start (Still Easy)

If doing things by the command line is more your style, all you have to do is goto the FBLA-Coding-master directory, then run the mac_start.command file.

Assuming you downloaded the repository into your Downloads directory.

```
cd ~/Downloads/FBLA-Coding-master

./mac_start.command
```
